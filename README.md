# 💼 Job Salary Prediction Model

A machine learning project that predicts job salaries using features such as job title, experience level, company location, and more. Developed using Python and various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## 📚 Project Description

This project utilizes a dataset of over 9,000 job records from Kaggle, focusing on salary trends in the data and tech industries. After thorough preprocessing and feature engineering, multiple regression models were developed to predict salaries in USD. XGBoost was identified as the best-performing model.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
